1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize] only specifies use of DTLS
   [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13] but works equally well for TLS.  For many
   constrained implementations, CoAP over UDP [RFC7252] is the first
   choice, but when deploying ACE in networks controlled by other
   entities (such as the Internet), UDP might be blocked on the path
   between the client and the RS, and the client might have to fall back
   to CoAP over TCP [RFC8323] for NAT or firewall traversal.  This
   feature is supported by the OSCORE profile
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oscore-profile] but is lacking from the DTLS profile.

   This document updates [I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize] by specifying
   that the profile applies to TLS as well as DTLS.  The same access
   rights are valid in case transport layer security is either DTLS or
   TLS, and the same access token can be used.

2.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA Considerations.

3.  Security Considerations

   The security consideration and requirements in TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] and
   BCP 195 [RFC7525] [RFC8996] also apply to this document.
